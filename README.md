  #  WORLD GLOBALIZATION TRADE SUMMIT 2021

This project is created in the context of the first capstone of the Microverse Training. For this project, as it is required by Microverse, I used the Cindy Shin template design. Two pages are created the home page and the about page and they are linked together. I The presenters section is created dynamically and the menu for the mobile version is also made with Javascript. Jquery is also used in the scripting. 

# The event is this project is not real. It is created only in this capstone. The name of the presenters, their title, position and description are imaginary.
